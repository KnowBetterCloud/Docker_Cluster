# README

This Repo is to provide guidance to deploy Docker in a clustered configuration (FKA Docker Swarm, and now Docker Swarm Mode?).

Anyhow - I have invested in this for studying for Docker Certified Associate.  Additionally, I have yet to deploy Ubuntu in any significant capacity - so, I wanted to learn how to deploy Ubuntu over the network, in an automated way.  (Note:  I *already* had built a "Kickstart Server" for Red Hat - DHCP, PXE/TFTP, WWW, etc...)  

## Automated Network Install of Ubuntu
I have worked through this in my other account (it's more aligned with my "old" persona - more Infrastructure focused)
